# What is Git?
## Git is a **DVCS** (Distributed Version Control systems) that stores data in a file system made up of _snapshots_ . 
### Each time you save a changed version of your project  _called commit_  Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

## Files in Git can reside in three main states:
* ###  committed: #### Data is securely stored in a local database.
* ###  modified: #### File has been changed but not committed to the database.
* ###  staged: #### Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.
